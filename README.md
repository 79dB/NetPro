# NetPro

Network Embedding framework in Multiplex Networks.
-
We consider node feature vector should contains all of information(Chemical,ATC,Target...)

The application of NetPro:

Drug combination prediction.Data from DrugBank, DrugCombDB, SIDER et al.

Five steps for NetPro:

1.constructing the multiplex drug-drug association network

2.Random Walk with Restart to identify closely related drug pairs

3.establish machine learning models to predict synergistic drug combinations

4.evaluate the toxicity risk for drug combinations with strong synergism

5.Randomforest classifier
